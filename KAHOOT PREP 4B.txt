- The conversion rate, p, is calculated by observing a binomial random variable [conversion or non-conversion].

p = m/n

- To avoid doing repeated experiments, we use the standard error to quantify how much deviation from average conversion rate, p, can be expected if this experiment is repeated multiple times.

- The z-score measures the number of standard deviations between the control and test variation mean values.

- Based on a standard normal distribution, the result is significant when the z-score is far into either the left or right tail of the distribution.

- Statistical significance is reached when the confidence is above 95%.

- Communicating confidence: Error bars provide a means of communicating the potential range of values that are likely to be associated with a particular estimate.

Quantifying Confidence
----------------------
• Simulating data
• Error bars
• Standard error
• Confidence intervals
• Prediction intervals
