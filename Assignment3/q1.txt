- Null and alternative hypotheses are used in statistical hypothesis testing. 

- The null hypothesis of a test always predicts no effect or no relationship between variables, 
while the alternative hypothesis states your research prediction of an effect or relationship.

- A null hypothesis is what, the researcher tries to disprove whereas an alternative hypothesis is what the researcher wants to prove.

- Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.


===========================================
- A t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two samples.
- It is used in hypothesis testing, with a null hypothesis that the difference in group means is zero and an alternate hypothesis that the difference in group means is different from zero.
