# A correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1 that tells you the strength and direction of a relationship between variables.
# how similar the measurements of two or more variables are across a dataset. 
# When one variable changes, the other variables change in the same direction. 
# A linear correlation coefficient that is greater than zero indicates a positive relationship. 
# A value that is less than zero signifies a negative relationship.
# zero indicates no relationship between the two variables x and y.
# Calculating the coefficient of correlation
