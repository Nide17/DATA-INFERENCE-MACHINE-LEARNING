4) So p(t) is the average house price? Yes

- House prices


5) 

The cumulative sum for each return



how to get the "lines that would correspond to a statistically significant result at p<0.05" in Q4? is it p = 1.96/length of the dataset?

- +/- 1.96 / sqrt(n)

PIAZZA
------
Q2.

Do we just 'estimate' or directly calculate the correlation coefficient?
- You have to calculate it.

Q4
use the Average House Price column for the y-axis

- Can I use the statsmodels library for ACF? YES


Q5
- What does the average annualized return from the FTSE100 mean?
- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aar.asp#:~:text=The%20average%20annual%20return%20%28AAR%29%20is%20a%20percentage%20that%20represents,the%20fund's%20long%2Dterm%20performance.

When you are normalizing do you consider the sign of the value you diving with or only magnitude?
- The value you are using to normalize is positive so there is no need to consider the sign of the value.



SOME EXPLANATIONS
-----------------

- The t-statistic is a measure of the difference between the two sets expressed in units of standard error. 

- A normal distribution has a probability distribution that is centered around the mean

- The Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) describes how far a sample mean varies from the actual population mean.
-The standard error of the mean is a way to measure how spread out values are in a dataset.
	Standard error of the mean = s / âˆšn

- Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

- Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.

- Variance is the average squared deviations from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of this number. 


- The one-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test that can be used to see if the mean of an unknown population differs from a given or known value.

	- null hypothesis: the mean of the areas is 5000.
	- alternative hypothesis: the mean of the areas is not  5000.
-To perform one-sample t-test we will use the scipy.stats.ttest_1samp() function to perform one- sample t-test
- The one-sample t-test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether an unknown population mean is different from a specific value.
