SERIES VS DATAFRAME VS ARRAY VS LISTS IN PANDAS

PANDAS INTERPOLATION 
--------------------
- Pandas dataframe.interpolate() function is basically used to fill NA values in the dataframe or series. 

NUMPY INTERPOLATION
-------------------
- One-dimensional linear interpolation for monotonically increasing sample points. Returns the one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolant to a function with given discrete data points (xp, fp), evaluated at x.

- DataFrame.set_index: Set the DataFrame index using existing columns.
- DataFrame.reset_index : Opposite of set_index.
- DataFrame.reindex : Change to new indices or expand indices.
- DataFrame.reindex_like : Change to same indices as other DataFrame.

2) v(t) = v(0)exp -at :exponential

4) monthly payment installments
- Loan repayment formula
- the period in months

5) 
break even point: day to regain an investment
- 100

day2 = 101*101    2010
- ACCUMULATE!!!!!!


6) Missing dates=interpolation

1st value gt 100, 500 ...

7) calculate growth rates
then their means

8) ratio of avg cases to death x/y
- mean of the ratio, plot it

9) normalization: scaling while keeping values

10) stocks
today - previous

normalize: 10/10*100
- start by 100 on all columns
- take the first row and divide with first times 100
- both columns


- growth rates: u need only two values
- D change/original value(previous)
- change: increase or decrease: 150-100/100 * 100
- do it on each column


-returns: 150/100(prev) - 1 * 100

pctchange formula for this
nanmean function in python don't use it
