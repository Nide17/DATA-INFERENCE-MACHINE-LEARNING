MAKING DATA VISUALLY ACCESSIBLE
------------------------------------------------
- Select sensible units so that nbrs. are rel. small
- Small nbrs. are easy to visualize
- Use ratios if normalization is appropriate
- Use rates if there is need to comm. speed of change

WHY MAKE DATA VISUAL
--------------------------------
- To comm. info clearly and efficiently to users via graphics
- To stimulate viewer engag. and attention.
- To help users in analy. and reason. about data and evidence.
- To make complex data access. understand. usable.

- Spatiotemporal data is the most challenging

DASHBOARD
----------------
- Screen that displays info
- Provides overview, most important data, insights, functions and controls.
- Help to be more efficient and fac. dec. making.

VISUAL DISPLAY OF QUANT. INFO.
-------------------------------------------
Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency.

GRAPHICAL DISPLAY SHOULD:
--------------------------------------
- Show the data
- Induce the viewer to think about meth. design. tech. 
- Avoid distorting what the data said
- Present many nbrs. in small space
- Make large data sets coherent
- Encourage the eye to compare
- Reveal the data at several levels details
- Serve a reasonably clear purpose
- Be closely integrated with statistical dataset
