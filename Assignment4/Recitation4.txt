- Sort the dataset from 1991 - 2016
- 
# Stepwise regression that uses a backwards elimination approach. This is where all variables are initially included, and in each step, the most statistically insignificant variable is dropped.

2b)
- BIC helps to know the useful ones.
- LassoLarsIC: set criterion to be BIC: used to penelize some varibales: normalize set to false

a) corr.matrix -> grad age also included
b) stepwise: used to select variables, select some variables, 
c) with stepwise model you build which variables returned
d) fit model again
e) compare: are you getting the same results

--
choose a metric for a linear model for predicting.

For Question 1 : since the FTSE report in organized from 2016 to 1991, is it wise to sort it to match the format of monthly dataset ?
From Eugenia Mawuenya Akpo to Everyone 02:24 PM
I am a bit confused about the question 2 process. especially for the d.
From Yves Ngabonziza to Everyone 02:24 PM
Yes
From Muhammed Danso to Everyone 02:25 PM
I don't understand Q2.F. Given a set of predictors corresponding to Carnegie Mellon University, what graduation rate value
should the most accurate model predict?
From Sanuratu Koroma to Everyone 02:25 PM
for question 2 when doing the linear regression, and more than one column has a p value less than 0.05. which one will you choose

@Nadia drop the piazza post right now, we'll comment

Right
From sdakey@andrew.cmu.edu to Everyone 02:28 PM
how is the stepwise linear regression different from the BIC
From Seth Abayo to Everyone 02:29 PM
Stepwise is more of feature selection whereas BIC it is more selecting best model from range of models
From lbizima2@andrew.cmu.edu to Everyone 02:29 PM
are we allowed to get data set from other websites than world bank indicator like Kaggle@question3
From Seth Abayo to Everyone 02:30 PM
@lbizima, as long as dataset are publicly available, you are good to go
From lbizima2@andrew.cmu.edu to Everyone 02:30 PM
ok thanks
From Sanuratu Koroma to Everyone 02:31 PM
oooh so we don't plot the linear regression models?
From Seth Abayo to Everyone 02:34 PM
@Mohammed, now you are predicting graduation rate but specifically to CMU
