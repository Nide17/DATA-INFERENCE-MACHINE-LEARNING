STEPWISE REGRESSION
-----------------------------

Backward elimination:

First, we set a significance level (usually alpha = 0.05). 

Second, we perform multiple linear regression with the features and obtain the coefficients for each variable. 

Third, we find the feature with the highest p-value.

Fourth, we check if p-value > alpha; if yes, we remove the variable and proceed back to step 2; if no, we have reached the end of backward elimination.
