LINEAR REGRESSION
--------------------------
- linregress()
- if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything.
- The relationship is the coefficient of correlation - is called r.
- The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related

POLYNOMIAL: When we can't use the linear.
------------------------------------------------
-  numpy.poly1d()
- if there are no relationship the polynomial regression can not be used to predict anything.
- The relationship is measured with a value called the r-squared.

Multiple Regression
--------------------
Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more variables.
